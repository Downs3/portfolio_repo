    <h1>Personal Summary</h1>
    <p>I live in Eagle Mountain, UT with my lovely wife, Julie, and our friendly Westiepoo, Mollie.  We move from Jefferson City, MO in March of 2014.  I graduated from Columbia College in Jefferson City, MO with a Bachelor's degree in Individual Studies with emphasis in Business Management.  I have worked in the customer service field for most of my career, currently working at Lowe's, and last year I decided to make a career change into web development.  I am really looking forward to this endeavor, because I can use my analytical and creative abilities to excel.  I enjoy going on hikes, eating out, traveling, and watching movies with my wife.  Individually, I enjoy listening to music, playing most sports, watercolor painting, and photography.</p>
